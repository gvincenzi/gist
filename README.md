# GIST, Goin’ back to the essential
## What's GIST ?
GIST is a manifesto about a way of making software development and digital transformation consulting.
> Digital Transformation and software development are not oriented towards the market but rather towards **one's own needs** : the goal is not to be ~~trendy~~ but to be **_effective_**.
# How to GIST a company
## Preparatory Epic
A **gist**_er_ consultant starts with a **Preparatory Epic** on 3 topics
- What are company missions ?
  - for each mission >> Describe process
  - for each process >> List all type of operational tools
## Security Epics
When the **gist**_er_ consultant knows the list of operational tools used by the company, **gist**_er_ will describe all security alerts.
For each alert the **gist**_er_ tells how to strengthen security while minimizing risks and works on a **Business Continuity Plan** in case of major crisis.
## Needs Epic
When the owner knows what his company is, **gist**_er_ consultant can work on what this company want to be. The **Needs Epic** will be based on 3 topics
- What the owner want to do
  - for each need >> Why owner wants to do this
  - for each reason >> How owner can do this

## Operational Epics
When the owner knows what his company wants to do, the **gist**_er_ consultant can start a list of **Operational Epics** responding to two rules :

1. All solutions does what I want, and doesn’t do what I don’t want
2. We must have an inventory of all data used and generated by our solutions 

## Analytics Epics
When the owner knows what his company will do, the **gist**_er_ consultant can start a set of **Analytics Epics** to imagine how we can use the _data_ of company new IT solutions : company generated data make sense of our designed solutions and can indicate new business directions.
